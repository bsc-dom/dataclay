dataClay Claystone (4.x)
========================

We will be naming our major releases, starting now. So welcome to the new version `Claystone`,
which is dataClay 4.x.

4.0 (June 2024)
---------------

It has been a year of dataClay 3.x. This 4.0 version brings almost no breaking changes, but there
are notorious architecture changes and new features.

Highlights
~~~~~~~~~~

- Internal refactor to leverage the ``asyncio`` library (along the asynchronous implementation
  of the gRPC library, i.e. `gRPC AsyncIO API <https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc_asyncio.html>`_).
  These changes should be retrocompatible, but you can take advantage of the new asynchronous mechanisms
  by using the homonomous methods in the client API (e.g. :meth:`~dataclay.DataClayObject.a_make_persistent`
  instead of :meth:`~dataclay.DataClayObject.make_persistent`).
- New experimental feature: :class:`~dataclay.alien.AlienDataClayObject`. See :doc:`/alien-objects` for a detailed
  explanation.
- New microservice: the proxy. This can be used to circumvent NAT networks (e.g. Docker deployments) and also
  provides a more secure way to access the dataClay services. See :doc:`/deployment/proxy` for more information.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Basic support for JWT tokens in the proxy.
- Starting the client automatically starts a new thread and an event loop within. This is used internally to
  handle the asynchronous calls and gRPC clients.
- Updates in the orchestration scripts.
- Added explicit ``get_attribute``, ``set_attribute`` and ``del_attribute`` RPC calls on the backend.
  This is transparent for the applications (read, set and delete of attributes continue to work),
  but allows the introduction of fine-grain mechanisms on the proxy and also makes the debugging process clearer.
- Offering a new :doc:`Zenoh bridging mechanism </contrib/zenoh>` (similar to the :doc:`MQTT </contrib/mqtt>` one).
- Removed the session and password authentication. This feature will be handled by the proxy going forward.
- Added healthcheck mechanisms (at the gRPC level) to monitor the status of the dataClay services.
