Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

To set up your development environment, you will need `tox`_ installed on your machine:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m pip install --user --upgrade tox

You wll also need to have `docker engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_ installed 
for `tox`_ to use `pytest-docker <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-docker/>`_.

Install dataClay in editable mode with the ``dev`` extra requirement:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -e .[dev,telemetry]

Running the tests
-----------------

When running the test suite, we use external dependencies, multiple interpreters, and code coverage analysis. 
Our `tox.ini <https://github.com/bsc-dom/dataclay/blob/main/tox.ini>`_ file handles much of this for you:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tox
