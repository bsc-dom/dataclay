# This requirements should be used for installing dataClay in the "legacy dependencies" flavour

# You will need to install these requirements before installing dataClay. You can do it with:
# 
# $ pip install -r requirements-legacydeps.txt -r requirements.txt
#
# Tweak the previous command as you see fit, assuming requirements.txt contains
# your own requirements. You may want to merge into a single requirements.txt.

# After the requirements are in place, install dataClay without dependencies:
# $ pip install --no-deps "dataclay=={version}"
