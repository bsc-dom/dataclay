""" Class description goes here. """

""" 
Use absolute imports. By default, when you import a package in Python 2, it adds '.' in the beggining, it means all 
imports are relative. It's a problem for our testing since our test can be in a package but our stubs are not including 
the package of the test (and shouldn't!). With __future__ we add Python 3 functionality for all imports to be absolute.
